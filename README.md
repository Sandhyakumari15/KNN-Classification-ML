# KNN-Classification-ML
K Nearest Neighbors The k-nearest neighbors (KNN) algorithm is a simple, easy-to-implement supervised machine learning algorithm that can be used to solve both classification and regression problems. The KNN algorithm assumes that similar things exist in close proximity. In other words, similar things are near to each other. Algorithm: The Distance Between two points can be calculated using Euclidean distance -Calculate the distance from x to all points in your data. -Sort the points in your data by increasing distance from x. -Predict the majority label of the k closest points. Note: k value defines accuracy of a model so try with all possible values of k
